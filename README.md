# Ball Classifier
An application of a Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition. This model is able to accurately predict between 3 types of balls: volleyball, basketball and baseball, based on users input. The project was built using the book "Deep learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch" as a reference.
